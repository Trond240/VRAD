## Abstract
**Technologies used:** _React, React Testing Library, Jest-DOM Library, Webpack_

VRAD is an application built with `create-react-app` that allows a user to book rentals around the Denver, CO area. The fetch API runs upon user login, gathering data related to listings within 4 Denver areas. Some of the focus points for this project included:

* Keeping state based components to a minimum, thus leveraging more functional components
* Becoming familiar with promises, nested fetch requests, and handling the UI based on acceptance of data
* Becoming familiar with routing and how to handle dynamic routes
* Writing tests for React components and some asynchronous functionality

## Future Iterations
* Break out the fetch API into a separate file to reduce the side of the componentDidMount method on the App component
